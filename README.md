# BPHealthKitDemo
A quick HealthKit demo project based on Swift language.

After writing a blog post in eary 2015 about using Sleep Analysis from Healthkit on Swift 1, 
I updated the post by illustrating it with a sample code now in Swift 2.2

Don't forget to add HealthKit permission under _Capabilities_ in your Xcode project.
